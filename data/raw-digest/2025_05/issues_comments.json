    "body":"@miklcct thank you for your remark. After reviewing the modeling for the Netherlands' fares, you are absolutely correct. It turns out that the current proposal misses a key piece in the fare calculation.\r\n\r\nAs referenced in the [notes](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1d3g5bMXupdElCKrdv6rhFNN11mrQgEk-ibA7wdqVLTU\/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6pydxswsohyw) for the 26\/11\/2024 Fares WGM, @skinkie shared an example with an equation explaining how the fare works.\r\n\r\nE.g. in the case of a GVB (4 km) + Arriva (2 km) trip, the fare should be calculated as follows:\r\n`GVB_fare(4km) + Arriva_fare(6km) - Arriva_fare(4km)`.\r\n\r\nThe current proposal overlooked ` - Arriva_fare(4km)`.\r\n\r\nWe'll write something up to address this and try to figure out where this complex case fits in the proposal, or if other alternatives can be considered to address it. We'll share it soon. @skinkie can also probably provide more context into how NL fares are calculated.",

Over the past two years, we have conducted extensive consultations through interviews, workshops, working group meetings, and public presentations. We believe these efforts have resulted in a well-rounded and well-informed proposal.\r\n\r\nThat said, to further synthesize the work completed and enhance overall understanding, we see value in **hosting a public governance presentation**. The time and date is still to be determined. We will be sharing more information on the public presentation here in the coming days.\r\n\r\nAlso, we propose **extending the discussion period by one additional month** to allow more time for review before proceeding to a vote. Please feel free to share the proposal within your networks and to specify who you might want included in the review of the proposal \u2014 your support in gathering additional perspectives would be greatly appreciated.",

    "body":"Hi @ckraatz, thank you for your thoughtful feedback.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the important perspectives you, @Bibiana-McHugh , and others bring to this discussion. However, I'd like to clarify that while [MobilityData's Industry Advisory Council (IAC)](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/mobilitydata_industry-advisory-council-expression-of-activity-7216881619616313344-WeXc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACAnvaMBFaolq5G1n79cvDdQiiORsQbSpGA) is an important forum for informing MobilityData's internal strategies, it is not within the IAC's mandate to influence the governance of GTFS itself. All discussions about changes to the specification must take place on GitHub, where they are transparent and open for the entire community to review and participate in.\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar, the Industry Advisory Council is a newly formed, open-to-all entity created by MobilityData. Its purpose is:\r\n\r\n> \"to help shape MobilityData's strategy by providing industry expertise and perspectives on the state of the field, needs and priorities, emerging items, business considerations, and new technologies.\"\r\n\r\n_We warmly invite anyone interested to participate in the IAC and share their perspectives to help guide MobilityData's broader work._\r\n\r\nThat said, [GTFS is a community-driven open standard](https:\/\/gtfs.org\/community\/governance\/gtfs-schedule-amendment-process\/), independent from any single organization's strategy, including MobilityData's. This is why all conversations about the spec must happen in an open forum like GitHub, to preserve the transparency, neutrality, and inclusiveness that have made GTFS so successful.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we have also hosted Public Working Group meetings to facilitate broader dialogue around the proposal. The outcomes of those meetings have been shared openly by posting notes and summaries in past GitHub issues, ensuring that all community members \u2014 including those who could not attend \u2014 can stay informed and participate.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the importance of robust feedback, we have **extended the discussion period** to give the community more time to review the changes and delayed the start of the voting period. At this stage, we are encouraging ideas, questions, and constructive dialogue to help strengthen the proposal before any voting begins.\r\n\r\nWe are also organizing a **public presentation** to help the community fully understand the proposal and participate meaningfully.\r\n\r\n**We encourage you \u2014 and all community members \u2014 to continue contributing here on GitHub, where all feedback is public and can directly help shape the final outcome.**\r\n\r\nThank you again for being part of this important conversation.

    "body":"I wasn't aware of there being a GTFS Governance Working Group until yesterday, and don't recall being invited. Eric Plosky did invite me to the IAC at someone's recommendation, and I appreciate that. I'm engaged now! Here's what I shared with the IAC.\r\n\r\nI hope to offer a unique agency\/vendor\/producer\/consumer perspective:\r\n\r\n- I managed Digital Communications at VTA for nearly 8 years. I rebuilt VTA.org around GTFS-Schedule and GTFS-realtime data, evangelized GTFS as digital public communication, manually edited GTFS with an Excel macro, bought GTFS-schedule and GTFS-Alerts publishing tools, managed those datasets, and launched an Open Data Portal.\r\n- I finished my MBA and founded [SimplifyTransit](https:\/\/www.simplifytransit.com), which is both a Consumer (GTFS-schedule, GTFS-TripUpdates and GTFS-ServiceAlerts) and Producer (GTFS-ServiceAlerts and GTFS-schedule data (when needed)\r\n\r\n**GTFS \"Governance\" Thoughts**\r\n\r\nI'm still percolating, but in a nutshell:\r\n\r\n- GTFS-schedule and GTFS-realtime governance should follow the same process and principles.\r\n- We need to **make it very easy to Experiment, somewhat easy to Test, and very hard to Adopt a change**.\r\n- How about the Diffusion of Innovation curve as a model?\r\n- What if **Innovators** and **Early-Adopter Producers and Consumers** kicked off an extensive and transparent **Test** phase during which they would actively advocate for more and more of the **Early Majority** to refine, test and build support for the changes? \r\n- The **Early\/Late Majority** would take the time and risk to invest in code because they see value in the change.\r\n- What if **Adoption** were a mere formality, triggered by the **Late Majority** (80%?) seeing that value, and nudging the **Laggards** to catch up (or not)?\r\n- Rapidly pushing through GTFS-schedule and GTFS-realtime changes should not be a tool of competitive advantage. That's not leadership, and limited adoption is the antithesis of MobilityData's mission.\r\n- We need to channel the good ideas of the **Innovators** into the opening of the pipeline, for the benefit of all. Running off on your own isn't leadership.\r\n- We need to decide who is \"qualified\" to vote and who isn't - see my **MDIP Certification** ideas further down.\r\n- Some of the examples Aaron and Bibiana have raised are evidence of the dangers of deluding ourselves by conflating voting on Github with actual adoption. _MobilityData's mission depends on actual adoption._\r\n\r\n**Industry Advisory Council and MobilityData's Mission (All)**\r\n\r\nMobility Data's mission is \"leveraging mobility data to promote safe, equitable, and livable streets **for all.\"** \"All\" is 100% of people. Therefore, **MobilityData's goal in GTFS Governance must be to maximize Adoption.**\r\n\r\n- To accomplish that goal, MD depends on people who \"make stuff,\" whether in the private or public sector.\r\n- The \"Industry\" part in the IAC implied, to me, people in agencies and companies who \"make stuff.\" Our stuff is used by thousands (or millions) of transit riders. I mean no disrespect to others who don't \"make stuff,\" and I respect that there are gradations of \"making stuff.\" \r\n- The Council part implies that it's a limited group, _not just open to everyone_.\r\n- If MD wants makers' help, it needs to Collaborate with and Empower us. It needs to be pragmatic, and sometimes bend over backwards to do so. We're busy running companies, building products, and supporting customers. (and being a father of two in my case)\r\n\r\n**An \"MDIP-Certified Badge\"**\r\n\r\nI think the [Mobility Data Interoperability Principles](https:\/\/www.interoperablemobility.org) (managed by MobilityData) could be part of the solution, if we could build them into a \"MDIP Certification\" program one smart data pro is pushing for (not sure if he wants to be named). \r\n\r\nThe [LEED certification program](https:\/\/www.usgbc.org\/leed) could be a good model.\r\n\r\n- What if government buyers started requiring MDIP certification from vendors, _multiplying MobilityData's power_?\r\n- What if the stronger your MDIP credentials, the stronger your voice in Governance?\r\n- What if MDIP credentials are strengthened (to a point) the more GTFS you produce and consume, commensurate with your impact in the industry?\r\n- What if you had to earn MDIP Certification by demonstrating adherence to MDIP principles, producing high quality and complete data (according to the MobilityDatabase), and through references from others in the ecosystem?\r\n- What if any entity could get MDIP-certified, paying a sliding scale \"cost recovery fee\" (as low as $0)?\r\n- What if not having the MDIP badge became its own \"carrot\" and \"stick\" to incentivize MDIP adherence?\r\n\r\n**Community Engagement thoughts**\r\n\r\nI spent 8 years leading digital comms at VTA, including digital community engagement during the pandemic. If you've been in government, you know that if key stakeholders aren't engaged things will fall apart. And you don't blame stakeholders for not engaging. That's a community engagement pro's job, not the stakeholder's.\r\n\r\n**I like the [IAP2 Community Engagement Spectrum](https:\/\/organizingengagement.org\/models\/spectrum-of-public-participation\/): Inform > Consult > Involve > Collaborate > Empower.**\r\n\r\n- Some stakeholders should be Informed and Consulted, and some you must Collaborate with more closely and Empower them to make decisions\r\n- Just because a stakeholder is enthusiastic doesn't necessarily mean they should be invited to higher levels of engagement.\r\n- A community engagement pro needs to work hard to Involve, Collaborate and Empower, because the most important stakeholders are often the busiest.\r\n- In GTFS, there are companies and people whose livelihood depends on GTFS (ahem). We can provide valuable and insightful feedback, support\/hinder implementation of a plan, and influence\/mobilize the broader community. And there aren't that many of us to engage with!",

    "body":"@ckraatz You raise some important issues, and they should not be ignored by this community, but I do think they extend beyond a scope manageable within this PR. Regarding some of your points specific to the adoption process, I wonder if it makes sense to introduce ideas of such magnitude this late in the process, given the nearly two-years of work to get the proposal where it is today.\r\n\r\nIt's of course unfortunate that there are people who would have liked to be involved earlier but were not, however improving GTFS Governance\u2014and the associated working group open to anyone\u2014has been a headline for quite some time now: It's been a fixture in MobilityData newsletters, regularly referenced in the MobilityData Slack, there have been webinars about it, and several active related GH issues have been floating around for well over a year. The ideas put forth in this PR did not spring out of nowhere, but hopefully lengthening the review period will yield more improvements to the extensive work that's already been done. I'd be interested to hear if there are specific ways we can improve upon what's already present in the proposal without over-encumbering or obscuring the process further. As an aside, I find it pretty ironic that we're seeing one of the pitfalls of the current adoption process (namely, the lack of sufficient engagement\/feedback earlier on in the process) playing out in real time with the very proposal to improve that process! :laughing:\r\n\r\n@antrim's thought experiment is a worthwhile exercise, but we can only speculate so far as to how a given change would have played out had we been working under a different adoption process, which is why a trial period is crucial. That said, I'm still happy to offer another, less hypothetical scenario: Flex.\r\n\r\nForgetting for a moment that there was even an entirely different version of Flex in its earlier stages (Flex v1), Flex \"v2\" itself underwent many, many incremental changes (I counted close to 12 breaking changes). What was considered the \"unofficial official\" Flex spec shifted for years after its initial drafting, with some major changes occurring less than two months before its vote. Early adopters had to account for all of these changes, requiring multiple updates to codebases and GTFS datasets. However, whether due to technical, contractual, or other constraints, not every participant in the GTFS space is able to make such changes at will, meaning there are still implementations out there adhering to various older versions of the Flex spec.\r\n\r\nHere are some impacts to Flex's adoption the proposed process could have had that come to mind:\r\n\r\n#### Separate votes for testing and adoption (for functional changes)\r\nI've already shared [my thoughts](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/pull\/544#issuecomment-2837169695) on the benefits of an early vote to test phase, but Flex would have had much greater stability earlier (meaning less required code\/dataset changes) had it undergone the same level of scrutiny it saw very late in its journey to adoption if there were such a vote.  Timing of early implementations and Flex's adoption process also could have been more closely coordinated.\r\n\r\n#### Clearer roles and responsibilities\r\nWithout official roles for an adoption effort and expectations for those roles, identifying bottlenecks preventing progress was difficult, especially for those less directly involved in adoption.\r\n\r\n#### Formalized adoption phases\r\nWithout clearly defined steps in the adoption process, forecasting when certain milestones would be reached was nearly impossible, especially for outside observers trying to determine when to procure or develop their own Flex-based solutions, or even just to consult on Flex as a technology.\r\n\r\n#### Issue before Pull Request requirement, official PR template\r\nThe Flex spec lived on a separate repo altogether, which is where discussions on changes took place, making the spec less visible to the wider community. Enforcing structured Issue\/PR phases with templates and within one repo could have avoided this kind of information siloing and encouraged more participation at all stages of development from the wider GTFS community.",

    "body":"@westontrillium I appreciate the great thinking and effort you and others on the working group have put into this. It's a vast improvement over the legacy process. And I'm sorry I wasn't paying close enough attention, or wasn't on the right email lists.\r\n\r\nThe notion that big ideas shouldn't be considered \"late in the process\" is an example of the [sunk cost fallacy](https:\/\/asana.com\/resources\/sunk-cost-fallacy). The amount of time, energy, thought and money that's gone into something (sunk cost) is irrelevant. In every moment we need to take the best next step, regardless of prior steps.\r\n\r\nI'd ask that these ideas I'm proposing be considered on their merits, not their scale or scope.\r\n\r\nSome more specific proposals:\r\n\r\n1. **Change First Adopter to Early Adopter**, to echo the diffusion of innovation model\r\n2. **Change the [Testing Phase 2.5](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md#step-25-testing) to require at least 4 Early-Adopters (2 Producers and 2 Consumers)** to both vote on GitHub and to begin the testing. This acknowledges the diversity amongst Producers and Consumers, and is an important mechanism to advance MobilityData's \"for all\" mission.\r\n3. **Change the [Testing Phase 2.5](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md#step-25-testing) to require that at least 20 Producers and 4 Consumers have tested the change.** Those numbers are somewhat arbitrary, but the point is to move closer to \"for all.\" Maybe it should be a percentage of Producers and Consumers, or those who are someday \"MDIP-Certified.\" The point is to raise the bar to move towards Adoption, incentivize the Advocate and Early Adopters to evangelize the change, invite and include more (\"all\") industry players in testing, and address more issues _before_ Adoption.\r\n4. **Change [Vote to Adopt 2.6](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md#step-26-vote-to-adopt) to require approval by 80% of votes, with at least 20 Producers and 4 Consumers approving.** This would be a fait accompli, because so many Producers and Consumers would have been deeply involved and already tested the change in code. The higher vote count incentivizes the Advocate and Early Adopters to _get out the vote_!\r\n\r\nI'm a proponent of iteration, so I'm open to exploring ways to phase some of this in.",

    "body":"@ckraatz while I _certainly_ support more implementations, I think the main issue with some of the changes: the data is not (yet) available (or worse: still cannot be expressed correctly), and the standardisation of it, may be a reason that new tenders require them to be added. 20 producers is _a lot_, but with what we have seen the actual problem is that the consumers (that matter) are actually limited to _early_ implementations within OpenTripPlanner, and the \"smaller\" proprietary ones, but virtually never Google, Apple or Bing. They have their \"extensions\" but those did not follow the push\/pull-standardisation proces but more bilateral, behind closed doors. The problem with this inability to do alignment is that this may result into multiple implementations in order to achieve the same results. Or in OpenStreetMap speak: _tagging for the renderer_. Effectively resulting in multiple feeds, targeted to a specific consumer. And that does not sound like standardisation at all to me.",

There is so much more we can do to make this process clearer and something that the community wants to use. We think this lays that groundwork and we are glad to have you here to talk about the possibilities moving forward.\r\n\r\nAs @skinkie mentioned, 20 producers requirement is very high for both voting and testing.

    "body":"@ckraatz Sharing some background here:\r\nThe current governance process requires at least three votes to adopt a proposal, and there is no requirement regarding how many must come from producers or consumers. Regarding the question raised by @skinkie, the working group has previously discussed this and reached a consensus on **raising the voting bar**. This is why the current proposal increases the requirement from three votes (with no role distinction) to five votes, including at least two from producers and two from consumers.\r\n\r\nAs we consider how high the threshold should be raised, perhaps we can also think about the following:\r\n- Given GTFS\u2019s backward compatibility, how many producers and consumers will be willing to invest resources in testing, compared to when a proposal is already formally adopted and stable? (Seconding @westontrillium's point that the testing vote in current proposal can reduce but cannot eliminate risk.)\r\n\r\n- How many proposals will be in the testing phase at the same time in the future? How long will they last? What influence might this have?\r\n",

    "body":"Following the discussion held during the April 22, 2025 Fares Working Group meeting (see meeting notes [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1d3g5bMXupdElCKrdv6rhFNN11mrQgEk-ibA7wdqVLTU\/edit?usp=sharing)), we\u2019ve made a few updates to this proposal to reflect the feedback shared and to clarify its intended scope. These changes are summarized below:\r\n\r\n1. We clarified the purpose of this field making it a bit more explicit to reduce ambiguity following @miklcct comments:\r\n\r\n- It now focuses on indicating whether riders can access a service by using a contactless EMV card or device as fare media, tapping on a fare validator.\r\n- Included a reference to pay-as-you-go, open-loop systems as an example to help frame typical use cases and the intended use of these fields\r\n- Specified that this is not meant to describe if cEMV can used to purchase fare products or load value onto other media\r\n\r\n2. We added explicit text to handle potential data conflicts based on @timMillet  feedback:\r\n\r\n- Reaffirmed that `routes.cemv_support` overrides `agency.cemv_support` when both are present.\r\n- Added clarification that, in the event of conflicting information, data in other fare-related files takes precedence over these new fields. \r\n\r\nWe also want to share some context from this last WG meeting: \r\n\r\n- The group emphasized that this proposal is meant to serve as a **simple and lightweight way** for producers to indicate that **contactless EMV payments are supported** in some capacity.\r\n- The aim is to enable consumers to display a basic message or icon (such as a \u201ctap-to-ride\u201d availability message) to inform riders that they may be able to access a service using a contactless credit or debit card and\/or a mobile device.\r\n- Regarding @miklcct and @timMillet feedback on scalability, the current approach is intentionally minimalistic to encourage broader adoption, particularly among producers who may not yet be ready to implement the full complexity of Fares v2. \r\n- As noted during the conversation, once the need goes beyond showing an icon in a UI, it may make more sense to use Fares v2, which supports more detailed fare modeling.\r\n- It was also acknowledged that **consumers will typically be responsible for determining** which specific cEMV cards or devices are accepted. \r\n- As mentioned during the meeting, this field can be a signal to the consumer to go search for which cards are supported by the agency.\r\n-  This is not explicitly stated in the description at this moment, but it can be added if folks find it useful.\r\n\r\nWe hope these adjustments align with the discussion and help clarify the intent of the proposal. As always, feedback is welcome from everyone.",

    "body":"OK, so the aim of GTFS is solely to deliver public, passenger information. Where should we draw the boundary between \"passenger information\" and \"operational details\"? For example, the use of `block_id` in `trips.txt` can be considered as operational details, but it may also be of interest to the passenger to locate where the bus he wants to take is, by tracing back trips with the same block id. Specifying \"passing points\" in addition to stops is also sometimes required to validate tickets, although the passing points are not listed in the public timetables.\n\nIn the \"best practice\" file, there is also a statement about deadhead trips:\n\n> Non-revenue (deadhead) trips that do not provide passenger service should be marked with pickup_type and drop_off_type value of 1 for all stop_times rows.\n\nTo be honest, shouldn't these trips be included in the file at all, but only supplemented by TODS instead?\n\nI will have a legitimate use of revenue trips where pickup_type and drop_off_type value of 1 for all stop_times rows, as in the pull request https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/pull\/533 to specify a revenue trip is not for general passenger service, but only for carriages of cars \/ bikes \/ wheelchairs \/ etc.",

    "body":"> block_id in trips.txt can be considered as operational details\n\nAs it is defined now, it's more like an operational detail. However, before `transfer_type=4` was introduced, `block_id` was clearly rider-facing. IMO the change in semantics for `block_id` when `transfer_type=4` was introduced was a backward-incompatible change that was not necessary. Since most feeds I see in practice still use `block_id` with the initial semantics, I would say that it's still rider-facing (in practice).\n\n\n>> Non-revenue (deadhead) trips [...]\n> To be honest, shouldn't these trips be included in the file at all, but only supplemented by TODS instead?\n\nShowing those trips to customers (even with boarding\/alighting forbidden) might be confusing to customers. I would say that the safest option would be to exclude them from GTFS (which has the sole purpose to be rider-facing).\n",

    "body":"@BodoMinea thank you for sharing this example and for working on Fares v2 for TPBI!\n\nI took a look at the GTFS and the validator code. The first record of the `missing_required_field` notice is row 8, so the error is only generated for fare products.\n\n[This is the code](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/gtfs-validator\/blob\/708856392268751b556fe51d6fa17c9f3f174a3b\/main\/src\/main\/java\/org\/mobilitydata\/gtfsvalidator\/validator\/TranslationFieldAndReferenceValidator.java#L142) that verifies `record_id` and `record_sub_id`. Basically, it takes the column names of the primary key of the table to be translated. If the length of that entire key is more than 1 (for `record_id` only) or 2 (for `record_sub_id`) it raises the notice, regardless of the values of those keys.\n\nThere is definitely a case to improve this behaviour by additionally checking if we can have one unique value by using what the translations.txt table has, ie: \n- If other primary key columns are empty; in this case `rider_category_id`.\n- Or if the `record_id` simply has different names. In this case, using `fare_product_id` is sufficient to differentiate different fare products.\n\nIn this context, @isabelle-dr @tzujenchanmbd we should also think about how to deal with fare products having 3 columns in its primary key (after the adoption of rider categories). That will only allow for matching fare products for translations based on the value of the `fare_product_name` field itself, we cannot effectively do it using `record_id` and `record_sub_id`.",

    "body":"Hello @miklcct . As promised, we have created a document exploring the possibilities of modelling the Netherlands\u2019 case and the limitations of Fares v2 in this context.\r\n\r\nThe main outcomes are as follows:\r\n- It might be possible to model the fare structure, but this approach would lead to the same bloated `fare_transfer_rules.txt` file that we tried to avoid by using `fare_leg_distance_rules.txt`.\r\n- We suggest focusing only on modelling the first case (total journey pricing) and implementing it in `fare_leg_join_rules.txt`. This will simplify the solution.\r\n- As for the Netherlands, it would be valuable to consider a specific extension that models its fare structure.\r\n\r\nThe full investigation is available [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/13zcemcolnFamC5MQ_8F_oK9xaV8GF50-Pc5S9mtRr8A\/edit?usp=sharing). This is also relevant for @skinkie to take a look at.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss this at the next working group meeting as well.",

    "body":"So I\u2019ll start by apologizing that folks have been asking Google (or me specifically) to comment on this PR for two months or more now, but for a variety of complicated reasons, I haven\u2019t had time to give the response this deserves.\r\n\r\n**I want to be clear from the start that I\u2019m +1 on the proposed changes to the GTFS Governance Process.**\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been directly involved in the outreach and engagement process that MobilityData led in preparation for this proposal.  I appreciate the thought that went into it and I appreciate the outcome.  I think the proposal is not a significant deviation from the existing process, but largely serves to document and codify what was already happening, with a few new guard rails appropriate given the maturity and scale of adoption for the spec these days.\r\n\r\nThat said, there have been a number of specific points raised in the discussion that I\u2019ll try to address below.\r\n\r\n### The Role of MobilityData as Maintainer\r\n\r\nI fully endorse recognizing MobilityData as an official \u201cmaintainer\u201d for GTFS in the GTFS Governance documentation, because Google recognized them as the maintainer a long time ago \ud83d\ude42  Specifically, I think giving MobilityData write access to the repo was a much more significant acknowledgement of their maintainer status than putting their name in the Governance docs.  But I think MobilityData continues to justify their role through their facilitation of spec changes, their advocacy around larger\/thornier proposals, and their work in the broader ecosystem around improving spec documentation and best practices.\r\n\r\nThey are a non-profit organization with a board elected by a membership that broadly reflects the larger transit data community and ecosystem.  This is about a best-case scenario for representative authority, as far as I\u2019m concerned.  Could they pull a heel turn and close the spec or documentation?  I find it extremely unlikely.  But it\u2019s also something that open specs are designed to recover from.\r\n\r\n### Number of Producers \/ Consumers Required to Vote vs Test\r\n\r\nI think the current proposal strikes a reasonable balance and I am specifically opposed to increasing the required vote counts to the levels proposed by @ckraatz.\r\n\r\nI think the proposal for separate Vote to Test and Vote to Approve votes captures the real pain points felt by early adopters who have expended a lot of energy keeping their initial implementations up-to-date with lengthy spec proposal discussions and revisions.  I also think GTFS is mature enough that the bar for adoption should be higher (thus codifying 5 votes with 2 producers and 2 consumers) without setting the bar too high.\r\n\r\n@skinkie and @ckraatz both make reasonable points about the goal of overall adoption, but there is no point denying the current reality: just because something is adopted in the spec doesn\u2019t mean Google will necessarily implement support.  But the corollary is also true: just because Google won\u2019t necessarily implement support doesn\u2019t mean something shouldn\u2019t be adopted in the spec.\r\n\r\nThe transit data ecosystem grows larger and more diverse every year.  Expecting 100% adoption (or even 10%) of a feature out of the gate isn\u2019t realistic.  Adoption takes time, energy, and resources.  Asking a spec change process to carry the weight of that larger journey is asking too much and is a recipe for stagnation.  Specifically, asking for more adopters of a proposal (or even for Google specifically) won\u2019t necessarily make it so.\r\n\r\n### What About Google?\r\n\r\n@ckraatz asks about what\u2019s working for Google and what\u2019s not.  To which I say, maybe don\u2019t worry so much about us \ud83d\ude42  I know how to work the spec process about as well as anyone when I need to.  These changes aren\u2019t for me.  They are for everyone else.  And that\u2019s a good thing.\r\n",

    "body":"First off, thank you to the over 40 participants that joined us last Thursday for our Governance Information Session. For those unable to make it (or if you want a refresher), you can find the presentation slides [here](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1bu9vz6BTVJ9iEsszGsF2O_OFKGCkGk_W\/view?usp=sharing). \r\n\r\nThe purpose of that information session was to provide clarification and context for our proposal and directly address any lingering questions you in the community may have had before deciding on next steps.\r\n\r\nThe key points from the session: \r\n\r\n* The Governance structure has worked well over the past twenty years, but needs to change to allow for continued growth, evolution, and community involvement.  \r\n* We showcased our pragmatic approach to establish a solid governance framework based on four key areas of improvement: stability, accessibility predictability, and diversity  \r\n* The proposed **changes to the process** include: a formalized Issue stage, a new Pull Request template, an Official Review Period, a new voting period before testing, and updated voting requirements.  \r\n* The proposed **changes to the documentation** include: formalizing change types, their respective processes, plus contributor roles and responsibilities to make what\u2019s already happening within the specification official.  \r\n* Our goal with this proposal is to establish a solid framework to build on, opening the door for future revisions to the Governance, such as merging GTFS Schedule and GTFS Realtime governances, for example\r\n\r\n*What happens next?* \r\n\r\nThe **next two weeks** are for final review on this proposal. Following this review period, we will assess whether to call a vote on the proposal or if more time is needed for review based on community feedback. \r\n\r\nWe encourage you to engage with the proposal and associated resources, linked below. \r\n\r\n- [NEW: Introduction Page](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/introduction.md)  \r\n- [NEW: Roles and Responsibilities Page](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/roles.md)  \r\n- [NEW: Change Types Page](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-types.md)  \r\n- [REVISED: Change Process Page](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md)  \r\n- [NEW: Pull Request Template](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/issues\/543)\r\n\r\nFor a high-level look at all associated documentation, check out our [Github branch](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/tree\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance).\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your feedback and our continued work together on this proposal.\r\n\r\nThank you again from the MobilityData Team.",

    "body":"I'm updating SimplifyTransit's vote to essentially abstain (+0).\r\n\r\n+1 for a very thoughtful, clear and thorough codification\/formalization of the current GTFS change process\r\n-1 because I don't think it will lead to more engagement and widespread adoption, priorities for me\r\n\r\nI see no reason for this not to move forward. I didn't understand until the webinar last week that the goal was to codify the historical\/current process. The working group has done a fantastic job of that, and I'm very impressed by their achievement.\r\n\r\nI want to clarify a few things about my proposals above:\r\n\r\n1. **I didn't propose increasing the Vote to Test count**. I proposed it remain 2 Producers and 2 Consumers.\r\n2. I did propose that **those who Vote to Test actually \"walk the walk\" and test the change.** If 4 contributors aren't willing to take the risk of testing, why not?\r\n3.  The push-back on my proposals to \"raise the bar\" and ask more producers and consumers (more than 5, at least) to Test and Adopt proves my broader point. Codifying a process that's led to low engagement and adoption seems likely to lead to more of the same, but I hope instead it serves as a strong foundation.\r\n4. I never set an expectation for \"100% adoption (or even 10%) of a feature out of the gate,\" as @bdferris-v2 put it. 20 Producers out of 4,500 GTFS feeds and 4 Consumers (including OTP instances and big agency-built apps) is far from 100%.\r\n\r\n**Adoption**\r\n\r\nI hope my points about overall adoption are more than \"reasonable.\" What would be the point of an industry standard that lacks industry engagement, or that's not widely and correctly adopted?\r\n\r\nAdoption is integral to [MobilityData's 2025 strategic plan](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1Hz08befa0Gfgwu-BQ9qDks9oAp_q0Pz7\/view?usp=sharing). Quality and quantity are both essential KPIs, and we need MobilityData to foster both.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to suggest MobilityData create a **\u201dTransit Data Adoption Task Force\u201d** with a focus on fixed route public transit, including representatives of leading Consumers and Producers. Its goal could be to \u201cidentify obstacles to MobilityData\u2019s vision of promoting adoption and quality, and propose pragmatic solutions.\"\r\n\r\nIf, as @bdferris-v2 says, we can't ask a governance process to \"carry the weight\" of adoption, then I'm curious what the answer is.\r\n\r\n**Maturity**\r\n\r\nI've heard and seen references to GTFS as being \"mature.\" As a Clayton Christensen fan whose built my products on GTFS, that worries me. Maturity, in the S-curve and Product Life Cycle frameworks, naturally leads to stagnation and then decline. I would argue that process is more rapid with software than other industries, and a low level of engagement could indicate stagnation.\r\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a discussion about what\u2019s going to replace \u201cGTFS 1.0\u201d if it's matured, I\u2019d like to join it. If there\u2019s not, consider it started! \r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the data standard that replaces GTFS will:\r\n\r\n1. Accommodate both internal\/operational and customer-facing needs for data standardization. If more scheduling and CAD\/AVL companies adopted such a standard, they could also increase adoption and quality of standardized customer-facing data.\r\n2. Encompass both planned and real-time data\r\n3. Start with global engagement (like MobilityData is aiming for with its 5 focus cities).\r\n5. Adopt governance successes of other industry standards that have led to much greater engagement and widespread adoption, like Bluetooth, USB, JPEG, LEED, [5G](https:\/\/www.5gamericas.org\/about\/mission\/) and the [International Organization for Standardization](https:\/\/www.iso.org\/developing-standards.html).\r\n6. Leverage the latest in data management, software languages, and AI, in case there's anything better than .txt, .zip, .pb and .xml.\r\n\r\n**Google**\r\n\r\n@bdferris-v2 I wouldn't say I \"worry\" about any company with Google's market share and market cap. And I\u2019m not worried about your ability to influence the GTFS community or mic drop in a discussion like this one.\r\n\r\nI would say I'm very interested in what Google does or doesn't do for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I have a product customers specifically buy to get GTFS-realtime Alerts into Google Maps (and Transit of course, but Google is usually top-of-mind).\r\n2. Google Maps is used by so many people (including potential transit customers) it\u2019s ubiquitous. The riding public depends on it, and with that power comes a responsibility.\r\n\r\nWhether Google decides to implement a GTFS change has an impact on millions of people and significantly impacts MobilityData's goals. If Google sees a problem with a GTFS change, or if some adjustment would add value for Google, we should capture that as early as possible.",

    "body":"Thanks @bdferris-v2 and @mgilligan for providing perspectives from Google and TriMet.\r\n\r\nThis community is now large and active, so I understand if you don't want your opinions \"carry any more weight than others in the GTFS community\". But from a governance legitimacy perspective, I think it's really important to hear that you support or at least have no reservations about process changes, including Mobility Data's role.\r\n\r\nFor the casual observer, GTFS is still perceived as a \"Google thing\", and for some significant part of the GTFS community TriMet is the \"original GTFS producer\". As far as I know, the core spec is a formalization of an SQL schema that already existed on TriMet internal systems. And I still remember being dismissively rebuffed when supporting GTFS in official (EU) contexts, by people accusing me of being a Google lobbyist and \"filling everyone's screens with advertising and manipulating results\" :)\r\n\r\nWhen Google and TriMet say they approve of what Mobility Data is doing and consider them the custodians of the spec, this goes a long way toward the community (including me) understanding who is responsible for maintaining the spec and adhering to their processes.\r\n\r\nBackrefs:\r\n- https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/pull\/544#issuecomment-2734906037\r\n- https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/pull\/544#issuecomment-2906006076",

    "body":"> This discussion reminds me of old threads on the internet about a \"reasonable\" maximum line length in text files, and how no person would ever have a use case for line lengths >10k. Or how the 4 billion IPv4 addresses ought to be enough for this new thing called \"internet\".\n\nThose examples are very general, global spaces: a single IP address space for the entire Internet, or a maximum line length that implicitly applies to every text file that will ever be created for any purpose. Here we are talking about something whose only purpose is to uniquely identify public transit entities like stops or trips. Even in a unified GTFS feed or database covering the whole world, being able to specify multiple transit trips per individual person on Earth may really be \"enough\".\n\nAdditionally, we are talking about best practice recommendations subject to revision, not hard requirements. If someone needs to represent more than one unique transit entity per person in the world, they can make an informed choice to sidestep the best practice. And if some day, for whatever reason, the average GTFS feed needs to represent more unique transit stops than there are atoms in the Earth, the recommendation can be updated.",

    "body":"Since one byte to store the length is probably the minimum anyway, I would propose to recommend *to producers* a best practice of max 255 bytes (1 byte = 256 values = 255 + terminating `\\0` for C strings). But I would also consider it a best practice *for consumers* to support at least 1024 character IDs everywhere.\n\nEspecially for `trip_id` it might be the easiest option for some producers to just concatenate some IDs that in sum make a trip unique in their system (such as `stop_id` of the first stop, `route_id`, `direction_id`, and `start_time`). So the thinking of producers might not be guided by \"8 bytes should be enough to address all trips on the planet\" but rather practical needs to create a unique ID with the least amount of effort. This approach (just as an example) could probably lead to `36 < x < 255` byte IDs but should still be fine.",

    "body":"I second @bdferris-v2's points regarding setting reasonable expectations for adoption among producers\/consumers. If we could get a rough number on how many entities (private companies, non-profits, transit\/government agencies with in-house solutions) actually produce GTFS, I'd wager it's a fraction of those 4,000+ GTFS feeds quoted earlier, since a single org can represent hundreds of those feeds (Trillium's share is somewhere around 400). Of those producers, what percentage is following current developments on the GTFS standard (not that this is a requirement to produce GTFS of course, but it does describe the organizations we're actually talking about in this context)? And of this yet smaller group, how many will have the means and business case to support a proposed feature as *early* adopters? I am fairly confident that number is *less* than 20.\r\n\r\nI think when we're talking about \"universal adoption,\" we also need to be clear about whether we're talking about universal adoption of the spec itself vs universal adoption of each feature within the spec. I believe the former is an appropriate goal for MobilityData and the wider GTFS community while the latter is not, given the breadth of use cases GTFS can fulfill. The GTFS community can and should have debates on whether a given feature *should* be universally supported on principle (e.g., accessibility info), but, as with any standard, there are certain components for which ubiquitous use will never make sense but whose presence in the spec is still justified. The quadruple forte is a relatively rare dynamic, but its inclusion in standard music notation sure came in handy for Tchaikovsky and his cannons.",

    "body":"@westontrillium Finding Producers to test should be easy because the [Producer role in this new governance](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/roles.md#producers) includes transit agencies AND their GTFS vendors. Transit agencies can just assign the actual testing work to their vendor, or the vendor can ask their permission to test with their data.\r\n\r\nIn other words, first 2 vendors could test a change with the GTFS feeds of 10 consenting agencies each (testing across a more diverse set of systems), then 3 major agencies test it in-house, then 2 other vendors test it = 25 Producer testers\/voters. If those numbers are too big, cut them in half. Anything bigger than n=1 would be better.\r\n\r\nFinding enough consumers to test changes is the real challenge, but there are 2-4 major ones plus a bunch of OTP instances and agency-built apps.\r\n\r\n@westontrillium you make a very good point that some GTFS changes won't be relevant to all agencies. However, fringe features could be the \"exceptions that prove the rule.\" Their rarity underscores the impact and import of most GTFS changes contributors invest energy in. For the majority of features, therefore, I would agree with you that \"the GTFS community can and should have debates on whether a given feature should be universally supported on principle.\"\r\n\r\nFor the less ubiquitous features, how about this in a future iteration once this proposal is adopted?\r\n\r\n- Require that the Advocate propose [the Presence conditions](https:\/\/gtfs.org\/documentation\/schedule\/reference\/#presence) for the change (required, optional, conditionally required, recommended).\r\n- Calibrate the voting and testing requirements to the proposed Presence conditions. Smaller if it's just Recommended or Optional, higher if it's Conditionally Required, and significantly higher if it's going to be Required of every GTFS producer and consumer in the world.",

Can multiple agencies getting GTFS from the same vendor each be identified as individual producers? Otherwise, a vendor could just add the new feature for as many feeds as they wish, ensuring they'll always have enough \"producers\" for a proposal. Am I interpreting the rules wrong here?\r\n\r\n> Calibrate the voting and testing requirements to the proposed Presence conditions. Smaller if it's just Recommended or Optional, higher if it's Conditionally Required, and significantly higher if it's going to be Required of every GTFS producer and consumer in the world.\r\n\r\nI fear this would just add more confusion to the process. Anyway, introducing new **Required** files\/fields or **Conditionally Required** files\/fields based on conditions that are already true for existing feeds would violate backwards compatibility. Thus the only Presence condition that we could modify the testing\/voting requirements with would be **Recommended**. But I think the decision to make something recommended as a best practice should be voted on separately as a non-functional change, and only once the feature in question is already being implemented as an adopted spec component (i.e., we shouldn't predetermine that something is recommended before we can evaluate actual adoption percentage).",

    "body":"Thank you @eliasmbd the session on the new governance proposal. In particular it was useful for me to see:\r\n\r\n* Motivations for governance change (slide 15): \"Stability\u2026 Accessibility\u2026 Predictability\u2026 Diversity\"  \r\n* Roles and responsibilities (slide 20): Note that MobilityData may play a role as Advocate for a proposal as well as Maintainer of GTFS  \r\n* Examples A1 and A2 (slides 27, 28\\)  \r\n  * networks.txt & route\\_networks.txt (#389, #405): Passed with 2 producers and 1 consumer, would not have passed under the new governance proposal  \r\n  * GTFS-Flex v2 (#382, #388 #433): This may or may not have met the threshold for the testing vote\r\n\r\nHere is some feedback & questions:\r\n\r\n* One goal is a more legible and accessible process, especially for a newer entrant. But the sheer length of documentation may have contributed to concerns and questions about the new governance process. **Might the volume of documentation and process also pose a barrier to participation?** I suggest an overview might be useful. e.g. a somewhat expanded version of this outline for functional changes:  \r\n  * Issue publication\/discussion  \r\n  * Proposed spec publication (pull request) (At least 7 days of discussion)  \r\n  * Vote to test (14 days)  \r\n    * Unanimous  \r\n    * At least 5 votes in total favor with at least 2 producers, 2 consumers  \r\n      *Question: \"First Adopters\" are testers and would or should declare themselves here?*  \r\n  * Testing phase (At least 7 days)  \r\n    * At least 2 contributors with at least 1 Consumer and 1 Producer (\"First Adopters\")  \r\n  * Vote to adopt (14 days)  \r\n    * 80% majority  \r\n    * At least 5 votes in total favor with at least 2 producers, 2 consumers  \r\n* **Why is there a higher bar to test a proposed spec than to adopt?** Do I read correctly that testing requires unanimous yes vote but adoption requires 80% yes? Is there some subtle reasoning here?  \r\n  * If some stakeholders WANT to take on the risk of testing some speculative features in the open before adoption before there is unanimous support, why would we want to stop them? They can choose to take on the risk that's acceptable to them. Any vote threshold is a minimum; stakeholders can control their risk by recruiting more participants in the process.  \r\n  * Note it is unknown what course GTFS-Flex v2 would have taken under this process. The testing consumer was OpenTripPlanner and the testing producer was Trillium. It was later adopted with another consumer, Transit.",

Could the DOT also vote and cite one of the feeds? That is what I had assumed.\r\n\r\n@antrim Yes, this is intended to follow the **\"One organization, one feed, one vote\"** principle in the voting process. We brought this up in this [comment](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/pull\/544#discussion_r2014895280). So your example is spot on.\r\n\r\nAlso in the [voting requirements ](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md#step-24-vote-to-test)of both votes it states: \r\n\r\n> Votes are considered invalid if:\r\n> [...]\r\n> - An individual or organization votes more than once (Only one vote per individual or organization is permitted.)\r\n\r\n[Testing requirements ](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md#step-24-vote-to-test) should be treated separately. A Producer could use multiple feeds to test as long as it provides proof of testing. \r\n\r\nDo we see a need to improve the language around this? Maybe include the \"One organization, one feed, one vote\" principle in the voting requirements?\r\n\r\n### Documentation overview\r\n\r\n> * **Might the volume of documentation and process also pose a barrier to participation?** I suggest an overview might be useful.\r\n\r\nThank you for bringing this up this suggestion. This is something we tried to be mindful of when we drafted this proposal. We had to remove many redundancies to reach this state and to strike a balance between too much and too little information. I think there is value in this type of overview, maybe in the introduction page? Something similar to how we formatted the presentation slides might work well there. \r\n\r\n### Declaration of testers\r\n\r\n> * Question: \"First Adopters\" are testers and would or should declare themselves here?\r\n\r\nAll proposals are different. Sometimes you know the identity of the testers as of publication of the PR and sometimes someone shows interest in the comments during the discussion. I think this can be flexible as long as it is known before testing.\r\n\r\nHere what the proposed governance states on this matter: \r\n\r\n- In the [Pull Request Template](https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/issues\/543), there is a section dedicated for Testing details highlighting the information needed. \r\n- During the [discussion period](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md#step-22-pull-request-discussion), one of the responsibilities of the Advocate is to update \"the proposal\u2019s contents based on the comments received.\" This would include testing details. If need be, we could be more explicit here about what type of content. \r\n- Also, in the [testing step](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/change-process.md#step-25-testing), it is the first action of the Advocate to confirm:  \"the identity of the [First Adopters](https:\/\/github.com\/MobilityData\/transit\/blob\/20250312-New-Governance-proposal\/gtfs\/Governance\/roles.md\/#first-adopter) which will test the changes and provide commentary in the Pull Request comment section.\" \r\n\r\n### Higher bar for testing \r\n> * Why is there a higher bar to test a proposed spec than to adopt?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this asymmetry in voting thresholds is to build support for a change earlier in the process. When the community backs a proposal before testing begins, contributors may be _more willing_ to take on the risks involved, making it easier to recruit for testing. Placing more importance on early-stage consensus also incentivizes the development of stronger proposals with clearer timelines. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, lowering the threshold for the vote to adopt reduces the risk of late reviews and objections undermining the proposal\u2019s original intent after significant resources have already been invested\u2014while still maintaining sufficient oversight to ensure that test outcomes remain aligned with that intent.",

    "body":"> This approach (just as an example) could probably lead to `36 < x < 255` byte IDs but should still be fine.\n\nIt would certainly work, and be fine\/reasonable by most measures. But considering the file size issues discussed above (as in my comment https:\/\/github.com\/google\/transit\/issues\/518#issuecomment-2522489082) there might be a real concrete advantage to generating short, purpose-made IDs. Enough of an advantage to avoid the \"easy\" approach of concatenating a few other IDs, each of which might be a string like `ab73b272ab206fa9466300168527dfa321446c76acc875678e53d90b05fb688f`.\n\nFor the specific reason of avoiding unnecessary jumps in file size, I suppose I'm advocating best practices like:\n1. Use arbitrary generated IDs of a length adapted to your quantity of entities\n2. Order stop_times by trip_id if feasible\n3. Expose other info about trips via extension columns in trips.txt (so it won't repeat on every line of stop_times.txt)\n\nMost large GTFS feeds are produced by software systems, not by hand or by hand-written scripts. The existence of best practices could influence or encourage people writing that widely-reused software to choose one approach over another, for reasons they might not think of spontaneously. The developer might be able to very easily produce simple IDs and\/or order stop_times on output, but just neglect to do so because no one mentioned this was preferable or advantageous.\n\nTo clarify, I do not have an absolute position on \"correct\" IDs. I just think it is useful to point out implications and make suggestions which help people make informed implementation choices. I can see the appeal of \"meaningful\" trip_ids made out of other IDs, maybe even advantages in them being naturally persistent across subsequent feed publications. But it is better for file size if they look like `9498_EAST_0645` rather than `1007_117_110_3ANTRAM-23_1128-0710HBK1281_5787_a0126881ee5ec9d45a87041cb8defe97f542a06ad8cad8219ff36d385d338f13`.",

    "body":"> Anyway, introducing new Required files\/fields or Conditionally Required files\/fields based on conditions that are already true for existing feeds would violate backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n@westontrillium Could you clarify what you mean, if, for example, someone wants to propose a new Required or Conditionally Required field? Besides saying it's \"confusing\" (I mean, c'mon, this is all pretty confusing) what would be the problem with having higher Voting and Testing requirements for changes that would be Required or Conditionally required vs those that would just be Optional or Recommended?\r\n\r\n> * **Why is there a higher bar to test a proposed spec than to adopt?** Do I read correctly that testing requires unanimous yes vote but adoption requires 80% yes? Is there some subtle reasoning here?\r\n\r\n@antrim thank you for pointing this out. I noticed it too, and figured I was missing the logic behind making it harder to test than to adopt. I would think we would want the exact inverse of that if we want to achieve innovation. \r\n\r\n@eliasmbd I find it hard to interpret the numbers in this proposal as showing that \"the community backs\" a change or there's \"consensus.\" \r\n\r\n> lowering the threshold for the vote to adopt reduces the risk of late reviews and objections undermining the proposal\u2019s original intent after significant resources have already been invested\r\n\r\n@eliasmbd you've essentially expressed the \"Sunk Cost Fallacy\" here. \"Late reviews and objections\" should be weighed on their merits, not due to a perception that (A) they're \"late\" (which they aren't if they're being brought up before a vote to Adopt) or (B) that \"significant resources have already been invested.\" Moreover, I'm surprised you would assume that feedback would challenge the \"original intent,\" but there are plenty of objections someone could raise that challenge not the intent but how well the proposal achieves that intent. \r\n\r\nThe likelihood of that is especially higher because of the minimal testing this governance proposal envisions. The more Producers and Consumers involved in Testing, the lower the likelihood of problems being identified just before Adoption or, worse, after Adoption.\r\n\r\n> First Adopters\r\n\r\nAny objections to calling them \"Early Adopters\" instead? This may seem \"in the weeds,\" but the contradiction between \"First\" and there being multiple Adopters is bugging me. The only reason I can imagine to make it singular is if one wanted to limit how many people tested, which the \"at least\" language indicates is not the intent. This is also a missed opportunity to align with the widely understood Diffusion of Innovation Model.\r\n\r\n> \"One organization, one feed, one vote:\"\r\n\r\nLike @antrim this principle was obvious to me. @westontrillium @eliasmbd I'm glad this is now clearly understood. Any other interpretation would concern me, as it would effectively increase the voting power of GTFS vendors while decreasing the voting power of transit agencies. That kind of disenfranchisement would certainly not further MobilityData's goals of engaging more stakeholders. On the other hand, what I'm proposing would structurally incentivize MobilityData's community engagement team, the Advocate, and \"First\/Early Adopters\" to bring more stakeholders into the process.\r\n\r\n**\"Steward\" or \"Maintainer\"?**\r\n\r\nWords matter a lot. I think GTFS needs more than \"maintenance\" to achieve its full potential. We need \"stewardship\" of this common resource. That word has some implications I think are relevant to MobilityData's mission:\r\n\r\n- Supervising and managing is foundational, but not enough\r\n- Sense of responsibility, duty, accountability, and obligation to the greater good, commensurate with the power endowed with the steward\r\n- There's a connotation that others have placed their trust in the steward\r\n- Brings the gravity of ethics, values and morality to not only _what_ the steward does, but _how_",
